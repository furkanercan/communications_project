# Communications Project

## Overview
This project is a modular and object-oriented Python framework for simulating a complete digital communication system. It includes essential components such as transmission, reception, modulation, error correction, and channel modeling. The project is designed for research, development, and deployment, with a long-term goal of optimizing it using SIMD or similar techniques.

## Features
- **Transmitter & Receiver Classes**: Implements the key components of a digital communication system.
- **Modulation**: Includes BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, and supports additional schemes.
- **OFDM Integration**: Separates modulation functionality and passes modulated data to the OFDM module.
- **Error Correction**: Supports Polar Codes with SC, SC-Flip, and future improvements.
- **Channel Simulation**: Models real-world communication environments.
- **Performance Metrics**: Enables analysis of BER, FER, and other key metrics.
- **Testing & Validation**: Supports short and overnight test runs with GitHub integration for automation.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo_url>
cd <project_directory>

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Example Simulations
Example simulations for the entire TX/RX chain are located under examples/ folder.
They must be run from the root folder.
First, set the environment correctly - otherwise the local exports may not get recognized:
```sh
export PYTHONPATH=/path_to_root_folder/src:$PYTHONPATH
```
Then, run the example script:
```sh
python examples/tx_rx_chain_example_polar.py
```
Make sure that the virtual environment is set correctly. The output should look like:
```sh

All run logs are populated under output/ folder, tagged with date and time. In each run folder, the terminal output and a copy of the configuration file is saved for convenience.

## Running Tests
```sh
pytest tests/
```

## Roadmap
- **Extend Modulation Support**: Implement 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and other schemes.
- **Enhance Error Correction**: Add LDPC and Turbo Codes.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Implement SIMD for efficiency.
- **Deployment & Acceleration**: Move from simulation to real-time execution.
