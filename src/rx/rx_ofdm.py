        Fragment the input received signal into chunks based on the size of subcarriers 
        and cyclic prefix length.

        When TX sends information, it is not evident to the RX that what's padding and what's
        not. In other words, TX keeps sending data and RX must discard some of this data, because
        they are redundant. The RX must strictly know what to discard and what to keep. 

        There are several different ways, and layers, to this concept, including resource allocation,
        MAC layer, control channel information, header assignment, etc. We haven't explored any of 
        those yet. For the time being we will be FIXING the frame size, and passing the code length
        as a parameter to the OFDM receiver, to tell RX what to discard and what not to discard.

        Current scheme:
        For any given frame, all subcarriers must be used consecutively to send data. The TX OFDM 
        must pad the remaining unused subcarriers in an OFDM symbol with zeroes before passing it to 
        IFFT. Consequently, at the OFDM RX, after FFT, the excess data must be found and discarded.
        
        Example:

        Code length = 8
        Number of subcarriers = 6
        Cyclic prefix length = 2

        Code represented by n, cyclic prefix represented by p. 
        Time domain represented by t. Padding represented by 0.
        
        At TX:
        Resulting 2 OFDM symbols: nnnnnn     nn0000
        After applying IFFT, (represent by t): tttttt     tttttt
        After applying CP:  pptttttt   pptttttt

        At RX:
        Remove CP: tttttt     tttttt
        Apply FFT: nnnnnn     nnnnnn
        Discard p: nnnnnn     nn
